# STM32F411-Nucleo Dual UART Communication 

This project demonstrates simultaneous UART communication on two ports (USART1 and USART2) of an STM32 Nucleo board using interrupt mode.

## Features
- Independent UART1 and UART2 communication
- Interrupt-driven transmit and receive
- Separate counters for tracking TX/RX events per channel
- 115200 baud, 8-bit data, no parity, 1 stop bit (8N1)
- HSI clock configuration with PLL to 84MHz system clock

## Hardware Requirements
- STM32 Nucleo board (tested with F411-Nucleo)
- Jumper wires for UART connections
- Optional: USB-to-UART converter for PC communication

## Wiring
For loopback test:
- Connect USART1_TX (PA9) to USART1_RX (PA10)
- Connect USART2_TX (PA2) to USART2_RX (PA3)

For external communication:
- Connect USART pins to your external device(s)

## Configuration
- Both UARTs configured for 115200 baud rate
- Interrupt priorities left at default
- 10-byte transmit/receive buffers

## Usage
1. Flash the program to your Nucleo board
2. The program will automatically:
   - Transmit test patterns on both UARTs
   - Receive data on both UARTs
   - Count successful TX/RX operations

## Monitoring
The counters can be monitored via:
- `tx_counter1`, `rx_counter1` for USART1
- `tx_counter2`, `rx_counter2` for USART2
- Global `tx_counter` and `rx_counter`

## Project Structure
- `main.c`: Core implementation with initialization and callbacks
- System files generated by STM32CubeMX

## Dependencies
- STM32 HAL library
- CMSIS core
